# Boredom Busters

## Introduction
Welcome to Boredom Busters, your ultimate boredom-fighting app! Developed as a  final solo project for mod3 at Turing, Boredom Busters was created to provide you with exciting activities and combat monotony.

With Boredom Busters,  you have the flexibility to switch between light and dark modes, ensuring a visually comfortable experience based on your preference. You will discover a random activity every time you load the page. If the suggested activity doesn't suit your preference, simply skip it and get a new one. Once you've completed an activity, mark it as done to keep track of your accomplishments and get your next activity.

The app also offers a convenient list of your completed tasks, allowing you to look back on your achievements and stay motivated. 

Boredom Busters is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, providing a seamless browsing experience. Say goodbye to boredom and dive into a world of exciting activities with Boredom Busters. Get ready to unleash your creativity and enjoy endless entertainment!

## Context 
Building Boredom Busters has been an exciting solo project. Utilizing React, PropTypes, Cypress, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I have created an exceptional app for entertainment and combating boredom.

React provides dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a seamless experience. PropTypes enhances code maintainability, while JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity. Cypress guarantees the app's quality through automated testing.

By combining HTML and CSS, I've crafted visually appealing web pages for an attractive and user-friendly design. Boredom Busters offers a diverse range of activities to combat boredom effectively.
